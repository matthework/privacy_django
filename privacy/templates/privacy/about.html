<p class="text-justify"><i>Technology has significantly changed our lives in every aspect. These days mobile devices become very powerful and functional to handle those jobs that used to reply on the desktop computers. As the result of the development of science and technology, working on the go becomes not just possible but also practical now. More and more people would like to effectively utilize their small fragments of time while they are moving or in public places such as coffee shops, parks, transport stations, trains and planes. This trend definitely introduces a new fashion of productive working style, but also bring us some concerns about potential privacy leaking. The shoulder-surfing and observation-based attacks are two major risks which are responsible for visual data security breach. This project aims to design a privacy-preserving system which allows users to securely display their sensitive data on screen in public. <br>
<br>
To achieve this goal, the privacy-guard system (PGS) is proposed in this master thesis, which is designed and developed as a robust solution for addressing the risk of visual observation attacks. The PGS adopts natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML) and WordNet technologies to analyze confidential documents and identify sensitive information intelligently. Then the system can automatically cover sensitive content with meaningless symbols and replace them with text-to-speech (ToS) code. As the result, the authorized users will feel free to work on their sensitive data in public place without privacy leaking concerns .</i></p>
