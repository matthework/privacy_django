<h2>Welcome to Privacy Guard System !</h2>
<br>
<br>
<p class="text-justify"><i><big>This web application is the implementation of proposed privacy-preserving system for my master thesis, which is designed and developed as a solution to address the risk of visual observation attacks. The proposed system utilises Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML) and WordNet technologies to analyze confidential documents and identify sensitive information intelligently. The system automatically replaces sensitive content with meaningless symbols. Text-to-Speech (ToS) code is embedded behind the symbols. This code enables the users to listen to the content of the original sensitive information through an earphone when the users tap on the symbols. As a result, users would be able to work on their sensitive data in public place without concerning privacy leaking due to visual observation attacks.</big></i></p>
