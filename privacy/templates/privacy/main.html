<h2>Welcome to Privacy Guard System !</h2>
<br>
<br>
<p class="text-justify"><i><big>This web application is the implementation of proposed privacy-preserving system for my master thesis. The system is designed and developed as a solution for addressing the risk of visual observation attacks. It adopts natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML) and WordNet technologies to analyze confidential documents and identify sensitive information intelligently. The system automatically covers sensitive content to meaningless symbols. Text-to-speech (ToS) code is embedded behind the symbols. The code enable the users to listen to the content of the original sensitive information through an earphone when the users tap on the symbols. As the result, users are able to work on their sensitive data in public place without concerns of privacy leaking due to visual observation attacks.</big></i></p>
